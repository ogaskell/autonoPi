# Examples

This directory contains example implementations of autonoPi.

- edukit3.py - this file will run on the testing vehicle, which uses a Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi Camera and a CamJam EduKit 3.

Note that due to limitations in how Python imports modules, in order to run these files you must either:
- Have installed the autonoPi module so it is available system-wide, or;
- Run the file from the base directory of this repository, not from the examples folder.
